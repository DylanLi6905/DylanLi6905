### ðŸ›  Notable Projects:
- **IntelliTeam: AI-Driven Collaboration Dashboard**  
  *January 2025 â€“ April 2025 â€¢ React | Node.js | FastAPI | TensorFlow | MongoDB*  
  - Enabled sub-100 ms, multi-user task editing and chat via Socket.io, synchronizing state for 100+ concurrent users through a Node.js backend.  
  - Developed a FastAPI microservice backed by TensorFlow for real-time sentiment analysis of live chat streamsâ€”achieved **92% accuracy** and alerted managers to negative tone **30% faster**.  
  - Containerized frontend, backend, and AI service with Docker and Kubernetes on AWS EKS; implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD to reduce deployment time by **50%**.

- **BowlBrains NFT Collection**  
  *January 2025 â€“ March 2025 â€¢ Solidity | Hardhat | IPFS | React | Node.js*  
  - Developed and deployed an **ERC-721A** smart contract on Goerli supporting batch minting and gas-optimized sequential token IDs (OpenZeppelinâ€™s Enumerable + Ownable).  
  - Built a React/Node.js front-end with Ethers.js and MetaMask integration to read on-chain state transactions and manage real-time UI updatesâ€”reduced mint flow latency by **25%** via optimized state management and batched contract calls.

- **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life**  
  *September 2024 â€“ November 2024 â€¢ C | Make | GCC | Git | Valgrind*  
  - Implemented a full-featured, command-line simulation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in C, leveraging dynamic memory allocation and pointer arithmetic to support arbitrary grid sizes and toroidal wrap-around behavior.  
  - Automated build and test workflows with a Makefile and Git; validated memory safety and performance using Valgrind to ensure leak-free execution across millions of generations.
